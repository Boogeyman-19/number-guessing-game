**Number Guessing Game**

This Python program implements a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.
The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

**Features:**
  Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 for the player to guess.
  Limits the number of guesses the player can make to 10.
  Provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
  Congratulates the player upon guessing the correct number within the allowed number of attempts.
  Informs the player when they have run out of attempts without guessing the correct number.
  
**How to Run:**
  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  Clone the repository or download the number_guessing_game.py file.
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing number_guessing_game.py.
  Run the program by executing the command: python number_guessing_game.py.
  
**Usage:**
  Upon running the program, follow the on-screen instructions to input your guesses.
  Input a numerical guess between 1 and 100.
  The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
  Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
